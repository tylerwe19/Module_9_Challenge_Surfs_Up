# Module_9_Challenge_Surfs_Up
## Purpose of Analysis
### W.Avy requested we complete this analysis of temperature data to determine if the surf and ice cream shop would be sustainable year-round and if the weather would negatively affect demand.

## Analysis
#### After completing this analysis I do not belive W.Avy needs to worry about temperature deterring customers/surfers from visiting the surf and ice cream shop. If you compare the summary stats of temperatures in June and December below, you'll notice there is not a significant difference in temperature between the two months.

### Key Observations of June and December weather:
 * Even though, the month of December has more days than the month of June, the sample size for June is greater than December, leading me to believe we have at least one year that is missing data for December.
 * June data is slightly skewed to the left as the mean (74.94) is slightly lower than the median (75), although it is pretty much symmetrical. December data is slightly skewed to the right as the mean(71.04) is slightly higher than the median (71); however, this month’s data is also practically symmetrical. Additionally, December temperatures have a slightly higher standard deviation indicating more variance among temperatures throughout this month, making it more challenging to predict the weather during December.
 * Both the mean and median are higher June than in December indicating that June is a warmer month; however, the difference in temperatures between the months is not dramatic.

## Summary
### This analysis presents evidence that there is little difference in temperature between June and December, which leads to little concern about temperature impacting customer demand. This being said, there are additional considerations and ideas for future research.

 * It would be interesting to see if certain stations have dramatically different temperatures than the average or more variation in temperature than the overall average. The stations are likely consistent with the average but checking the summary stats of temperatures at each station is worth the effort to ensure a certain station does not experience drastically temps than what we’ve observed or consistently lower or higher temps than what we’ve observed. 
 * I would suggest working with W.Avy to establish a temperature threshold for when it’s too cold to surf or eat ice cream. It would be interesting to bring in number of customers or surfers field and compare these numbers to the temperature. Is there a certain temperature where if the weather becomes colder than this temperature, then the number of customers/surfers dramatically decrease. If we’re able to determine this, it would be a valuable exercise to calculate the percentage or number of days that are below this temperature. It would also be interesting to see if there’s a correlation between temperature and precipitation. Does it normally rain on colder days?
